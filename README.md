# Garry's Mod Server Launcher With Console Support
 This is meant to act as a replacement launcher for hosts who want to use the full console while also wanting to choose the map the server starts on, since the normal UI version doesn't include that feature.

## Launcher Variations:
I'm including the launchers I use for the Lambda Gaming servers since they're slightly different than the main customizable one, but note that I'm only giving support for the main version.
<ul>
	<li>Main version: Customizable without the need to recompile. Includes console mode, map selection, LAN mode, max players selection, password option, and gamemode selection.</li>
	<li>CityRP: Includes console mode, map selection, LAN mode, and max players selection. Also includes an old console version with only map selection.</li>
	<li>Sandbox: Includes console mode, LAN mode, max players selection, map selection, and an option for the program to pick a random map.</li>
	<li>HLU RP: Includes console mode, LAN mode, max players selection, gamemode selection, and map selection based on selected gamemode.</li>
</ul>
