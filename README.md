# Garry's Mod Server Launcher GUI With Console Support - Extra Builds
 These are extra builds of the Gmod server launcher that I use for my own servers. I'm including them here since they're slightly different from the main build and some people may want to edit them for their own needs. Please note however that I will not be giving support for these builds, and that, unlike the main build, most features of these builds are hard-coded and cannot be changed without a recompile.

## Variations:
 Below are the included variations of the server launcher and their features.
